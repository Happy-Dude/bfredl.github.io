# Title: Neovim 0.5

---

# Agenda

1. Whoami?
2. Neovim: 0.4: grids and floats
3. Neovim 0.5: tree-sitter and LSP
4. The neovim community: the good and the would-be-better
5. what is neovim, really?

---

# Introduction

---

# Grids

screen.c was refactored to render each window on a separate grid.

shoutout: GSOC student 2018 Utkarshme

this allows some nice stuff, such as the float and the different font size.

# community

Formalizing the unformalized:
 - member of `github.com/neovim` org, get 1 free membership badge
 - triage, can edit labels and milestones
 - write, can actually push stuff

or, limited access to `neovim/xx.nvim` repo.

# the uncanney valley

- Nvim has good `runtime/lua` etc
- a large cataloge of good/bad/ugly third-party plugins (show the "related projects" horrorshow)
- the "excluded middle": standardized interfaces _between_ plugins (incl UI:s which just are plugins, anyway)
- "frameworks" used by plugins (no dependency mgmt)

---

# the uncanney valley: how to fix it

- interfaces defined by *reference implementations* in `neovim/` and `nvim-lua/`
- `nvim-lua/*` as a sandbox for WIP interfaces, promote to `neovim/*` (or runtime already) when done
- example:
  - `norcalli/snippets.lua` should at least be promoted to `nvim-lua/`
  - a subset of the API should be standardized as the "official" snippets API.
  - user can swap in a different snippets implementation

- "strong defaults" and "flexibility/extensibility", **choose two**.
- `runtime/lsp` provides "out of the box" experience, but you can override any callback

---

# Can has package dependencies?

Similarily, Nvim could "adopt" one package manager (packer.nvim, or something else).
- define the "standard" for plugin dependencies once for all
- should be easy for all other active packagers to adopt
- "design by commitee" does NOT work when the comitee is over 9000 plugin developers
- Nvim core team should decide on one "good enough" solution for 0.5 (ofc discussion with large community, but we need to set the foot down)
- being shipped with Neovim 0.5 enough to bootstrap community momentum.
- can revisit before 1.0 (if misstakes be made)

- build system already uses luarocks, share it to lua plugins
```lua
 local cjson = vim.require'cjson' -- prompt user to install binary dep if needed
```
