BUGSS:
  - [x] pum is WRONG in right vsplit
  - [ ] float will clobber msgsep if float touches bottom of screen

FEATURES:
  - [ ] universal winhl
  - [ ] setl guifont
  - [ ] RUNTIME:
    - [ ] lua lib for output buffer/ansi parsing

UNRELATED:
  - [x] remove ui_options breakage in terminal/tui_spec.lua

UNNECESSARY REDRAWS:
  - [x] nvim_command
  - [x] debug_sign specific redraw entry points (just mark for later redraw!)

MINOR QUIBBLES:
  - [x] check remaining invalid default_grid.Rows!
  - [x] delete ui_has() in ui_line() and ui_grid_cursor_goto() (already done in float PR?)
  - [x] related: simplify grid adjustment. i e row_offset in screen.c only, NOT ui.c!(extract from float PR!)
  - [ ] rename DEFAULT_GRID_HANDLE
  - [-] delete grid_assign_handle (float PR??)
  - [ ] Screen:_handle_win_pos indent.
  - [x] grid_puts_line_flush move `grid` to start
  - [ ] join: if (schar_cmp(grid->chars[off], sc) || grid->attrs[off] != attr) {
  - [ ] line_offset/line_wraps type + use malloc(sizeof(*array)) !
  - [ ] also malloc(sizeof(*linebuf_char)
  - [x] define SCREEN_GRID_INIT?
  - [x] check the mess around win_alloc_lines and win_free_lsize
  - [x] delet screen_valid already
  - [x] screenalloc, screenclear, screenclear2: DO SOMETHING

Whatever
  - [ ]

A MORE MAJOR QUIBBLE:
  - [ ] refactor all the shit around screenalloc and ui_refresh
